# Introduction

Welcome to the development project of the Discord Management Bot!
This project aims to create a powerful tool to assist in Discord server administration, providing useful and customizable functionalities.

# Objective

The main goal of the Bot is to simplify administrative tasks, improve interaction among server members, and offer a more personalized experience. Some features include moderation, event tracking, and more.

Of course, this project currently has only a limited set of features, but it serves as a great starting point for future implementations.

# Technologies Used
The project is developed in Node.js, leveraging the Discord.js library to interact with the Discord API.
Additionally, modern asynchronous programming techniques will be implemented to ensure efficient and responsive execution.

- Node.js (v18)
- Express.js
- Typescript
- Jest
- MongoDB / Mongoose
